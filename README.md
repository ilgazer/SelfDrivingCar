# SelfDrivingCar

The aim of this project was to drive a toy car wth various peripherals attached in order to make it autonomously drive in a lane marked by led strips on either side. The project used an STM32L552 board, as well as a variety of peripherals including an ultrasonic sensor, LDRs, LEDs, a motor controller as well as a joystick. The code does not make use of the HAL, instead accessing the low-level hardware registers to control the MCU. You are invited to read the Project Report for further details.
